# Caprae Capital AI Readiness Challenge – Lead Enrichment Tool

## Problem Addressed
Sales teams often waste time chasing cold, irrelevant leads. Our tool enriches raw domains with valuable business data and scores them based on sales readiness.

## What We Built
- A lightweight pipeline that:
  - Accepts a list of company domains
  - Enriches each with tech stack, industry, employee count, and recent news
  - Scores leads using a rules-based model

## Why This Matters
This solution helps prioritize outreach toward companies that are:
- Tech-savvy (use tools like AWS)
- Actively growing (recent news)
- Fit the firm’s core verticals (e.g., Fintech, SaaS)

## Technical Overview
- Python-based CLI + Streamlit UI
- Simulated enrichment (real APIs can be integrated)
- Scoring logic built using business rules (can extend to ML)

## Real-World Impact
With this tool, Caprae or its portfolio companies can quickly surface high-quality B2B leads without hours of manual research or wasteful scraping.
